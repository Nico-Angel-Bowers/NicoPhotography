    <p>
        I am passionate about creating a space for freedom of expression through photography.
        Based in Exeter, New Hampshire, this website began as a way to share my own work in a
        clean, intentional, and professional space.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time, I hope this site grows into more than just a home for my photography.
        My goal is for Nico’s Photography to become a platform where others can also share
        their perspectives, creativity, and visual stories.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was born in New York City, above my parents’ restaurant, Corner Social.
        In 2026, I created this site with the simple idea that photography deserves
        a space that feels thoughtful, calm, and honest.
