    <h2>About</h2>

    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>
        I am passionate about creating a space for freedom of expression. Based in Exeter, New Hampshire,
        I am dedicated to providing an exceptional website to host photos and creations that meet the needs
        of my customers. With a commitment to quality and innovation, I aim to inspire and engage with
        everyone who visits my site.

    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>
        I was born in New York City, above my parent’s restaurant Corner Social. I founded this website in
        2016 with the vision of a way to share photography in a professional way.
