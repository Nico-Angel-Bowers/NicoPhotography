        <p>
            I am passionate about creating a space for freedom of expression through photography.
            Based in Exeter, New Hampshire, this site began as a way to share my own work in a
            clean and intentional environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope Nico’s Photography grows into more than just a personal portfolio — becoming
            a platform where other photographers can share their perspectives and creative work.

            I was born in New York City above my parents’ restaurant, Corner Social.
            In 2026, I created this site to give photography a space that feels calm,
            honest, and thoughtfully curated.
